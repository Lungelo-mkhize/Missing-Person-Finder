The "Missing Person Finder" is an Android application developed using Java and Android Studio. 
The main objective of the app is to provide a platform for users to report cases of missing people and
facilitate the coordination between the public and local law enforcement agencies, specifically the nearest police station.

Key features of the app include:

User Registration: Users can create accounts on the app to access its features securely.
Missing Person Reporting: The app allows users to report cases of missing people by providing relevant details such as the person's name, age, description, last known location, and a photo if available.
Location Services: The app utilizes location services to automatically detect the user's current location when filing a missing person report.
Notification to Police: Once a missing person report is filed, the app sends the report details to the nearest local police station, ensuring swift action and coordination in locating the missing individual.
Search and Alert Functionality: Users can search for reported missing persons based on various criteria and receive alerts or updates on the status of the search efforts.
Safety Tips and Resources: The app provides safety tips and resources for users to take proactive measures in preventing incidents of missing persons and staying safe.
The development process involved designing an intuitive user interface (UI) for ease of use, implementing secure user authentication and data transmission protocols,
integrating location-based services for accurate reporting, and establishing a communication channel with local law enforcement agencies for efficient handling of missing person cases.

The "Missing Person Finder" app aims to leverage technology to improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of missing person investigations, 
empower communities to contribute to public safety efforts, and ultimately enhance the chances of locating and reuniting missing individuals with their families.
